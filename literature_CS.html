<tr><td>cell injury</td><td>Cellular Senescence</td><td>Based on our findings, cytosol GSH-PO may play an important role in protective effects against cell injury by lipid peroxides induced in the process of the steroid hormone synthesis or the cellular aging process, and mitochondrial GSH-PO was strongly suggested to be one of the most important enzymes for steroidogenesis, especially cortisol synthesis.</td><td><a href=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8797265>8797265</td>
<tr><td>Diabetic Nephropathy</td><td>Cellular Senescence</td><td>We conclude that an acceleration of cell aging is a peculiar feature of diabetic kidney disease and may contribute to its pathological tissue changes.</td><td><a href=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8807595>8807595</td>

<tr><td>Hemolysis (biological function)</td><td>Cellular Senescence</td><td>The chronic haemolysis of the patients' blood due to SASP might explain the similar RBC folate values in the two groups because of a relatively higher folate content of young erythrocytes.</td><td><a href=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8869665>8869665</td>
<tr><td>Hemolysis (biological function)</td><td>Cellular Senescence</td><td>In conclusion, our results support previous findings of folate deficiency and haemolysis occurring in a considerable fraction of patients receiving treatment with SASP.</td><td><a href=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8869665>8869665</td>
<tr><td>Bacterial resistance, Hypochlorhydria, Congenital dysmotility of small intestine</td><td>Cellular Senescence</td><td>Small intestinal dysmotility, rather than fasting hypochlorhydria or mucosal immunosenescence, probably is responsible for the prevalence of bacterial overgrowth in this group.</td><td><a href=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8995936>8995936</td>
