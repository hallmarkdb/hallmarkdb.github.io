### The AgingHallmarkDB web resource

The AgingHallmarkDB web resource is in this folder. 
To view the web resource, it is best to begin by opening the ‘index.html’ file in a web browser and navigate from this web page on a laptop or desktop computer. 
The bipartite graphs are loaded from the GitHub repository, “ucbtchf07/bipartite_graphs”. However, the JSON files are also included in the subfolder, “bipartite_graphs”. 
The JavaScript function used to display manual curation results as bipartite graphs was developed previously (https://d3js.org/), as was the JavaScript function for interactive tables (https://www.w3schools.com/).
